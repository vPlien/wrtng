# wrtng

### ~/. reason for making this
wrtng is intended for my own personal use as a note taking, to do and blog writing CLI script. I strongly enjoyed using jrnl but found it not really portable enough when working with servers and syncing with git didn't go as smooth as I wanted to. When looking into ways to make my own I found did.txt and this gave me a starting point to start writing my own solution. My goal is to make a way to easily write notes on the command line, and put them in a journal or a directory.

### ~/. functionality
- [x] editing in vim 
- [x] portable (easy to clone with git as long as you have bash and minimal dependencies)
- [ ] multiple journals (notes, todo, blogs, etc.)
- [ ] sync with git 
- [ ] markdown support (easy viewing on github, exporting to blog, etc.)
