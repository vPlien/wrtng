# wrtng

### ~/. reason for making this
The reason I'm creating wrtng is to have a program on the command line for my notes, todo and blogs.
I enjoyed using jrnl but wanted something easier to install and sync with git, when looking for more information I found did.txt and this gave me a starting point to create my own solution. 

### ~/. functionality
- [x] editing in vim 
- [x] portable (easy to clone with git as long as you have bash and minimal dependencies)
- [ ] multiple journals (notes, todo, blogs, etc.)
- [ ] sync with git 
- [ ] markdown support (easy viewing on github, exporting to blog, etc.) 

### ~/. installation
1. Clone this repository
'git clone https://github.com/vPlien/wrtng.git'
2. Add the following line to your .bashrc or .zshrc
'alias wrtng "~/path/to/wrtng.sh"'
